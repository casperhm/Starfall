# Starfall

I recommend using the Square font

Map files must be Sqaures - 50x50, 100x100, NOT 100x150

The first line of a map file is the message that will print when in that map., or that fight.

The game does not support tall terminals. The terminal is HIGHLY RECCOMENDED to be no more that 2/3 the length in verticality, weird stuff happenbs if you ignore this.

Fight chance (the chance to encounter an enemy ship each time you move on the main map) can be altered by changing line 111 of the StarFall class. Maybe in the future i will add a config file where you can change this sort of thing.
